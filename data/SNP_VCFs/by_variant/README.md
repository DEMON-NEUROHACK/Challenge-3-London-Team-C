## SNP_VCFs.all.tsv.gz 

All 20 MND ALS dummy VCFs from *SNP_VCFs/* merged into one participant x variant matrix.

The matrix is filled with genotypes numerically encoded as detailed [here](https://github.com/DEMON-NEUROHACK/Challenge-3-London-Team-C/blob/main/data/genotype_encodings.csv). 

## SNP_VCFs.merged.tsv.gz 

All 20 MND ALS dummy VCFs from *SNP_VCFs/* merged into a `data.table` in long-format. 

This is the data from which *SNP_VCFs.all.tsv.gz* is derived.
